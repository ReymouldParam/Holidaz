of planning and gathering all details from each member in the group. Very good 
(and am sure not easy :) coordination for several months. Leading up to a very well curated 
planned and executed trip. Involving 42 members, 3 cities stay, 10+ places visited, 
with flight coach bullet train and cruise transports. Founders of HolidaZ, Vijay and Preeti, 
personally took care of all arrangements. Great fun. Thanks to Vijay for accompanying us also.`
